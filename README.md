# Glossary for common R functions

This GitHub repository will be used to create explanation pages for common functions in R.
Students should contribute to expand this glossary by adding a small explanation on a particular function that
they would like to present.

## Concept

Whenever you use/discover a new, cool function in R, please write a short description of that function as a wiki page (see below for details). As more and more students contribute, we will create a comprehensive collection of R functions.

## Rules

* there should be one glossary page for each function (exception: the intro page 00, which contains several functions)
* these pages are created as wiki pages (see wiki tab in the menu bar)
* the name of the page should be the name of the function!

## Detailed explanation

1. click on the wiki tab in the menu bar; then click on the green "New page" button on the right

2. You should now fill some fields:
    * In the name bar, give the name of the R function you want to describe
    * In the main text field, describe the function, and include R code inside the ```{r} ... ``` delimiters

The text syntax is called **Markdown**, and is very intuitive. Check [this cheatsheet for example](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
