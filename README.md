# Glossary for common R functions

This GitHub repository will be used to create explanation pages for common functions in R.
Students should contribute to expand this glossary by adding a small explanation on a particular function that
they would like to present.

## Rules

* there should be one glossary page for each function (exception: the intro page 00, which contains several functions)
* these pages are created as wiki pages (see wiki tab in the menu bar)
* the name of the page should be the name of the function!

## Detailed explanation
